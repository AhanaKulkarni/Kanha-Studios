# Kanha Studio - Creative Design Studio

## Overview

Kanha Studio is a modern full-stack web application for a creative design studio inspired by Krishna devotion and based in Vrindavan. The application serves as a portfolio and business website featuring a divine aesthetic with Krishna-inspired design elements, Sanskrit quotes, and spiritual motifs.

## System Architecture

### Frontend Architecture
- **Framework**: React 18 with TypeScript
- **Build Tool**: Vite for fast development and optimized production builds
- **Routing**: Wouter for lightweight client-side routing
- **UI Components**: Radix UI primitives with shadcn/ui component system
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS with custom Krishna-inspired color palette
- **State Management**: TanStack Query for server state management
- **Forms**: React Hook Form with Zod validation
- **Animations**: GSAP with ScrollTrigger for advanced animations

### Backend Architecture
- **Runtime**: Node.js with Express.js server
- **Language**: TypeScript with ES modules
- **Database**: PostgreSQL with Drizzle ORM
- **Database Provider**: Neon Database (serverless PostgreSQL)
- **Session Management**: Express sessions with PostgreSQL store
- **API Design**: RESTful API endpoints

### Design System
- **Component Library**: Custom implementation using Radix UI + shadcn/ui
- **Theming**: CSS custom properties with light/dark mode support
- **Typography**: Playfair Display (serif) + Poppins (sans-serif)
- **Color Palette**: 
  - Midnight Blue (primary): `hsl(245, 58%, 51%)`

- **Portfolio**: Project gallery with filtering capabilities
- **Contact**: Contact form with validation and submission handling

### UI Features
- **Custom Cursor**: Animated cursor with trailing effects
- **Floating Elements**: Decorative spiritual symbols (üçÉ, ü™∂)
- **Navigation**: Floating navigation bar with smooth animations

## Data Flow

### Client-Side Data Flow
1. User interactions trigger React component state changes
2. Form submissions use React Hook Form with Zod validation
3. API calls managed through TanStack Query for caching and state management
4. Server responses update UI components and display toast notifications

### Server-Side Data Flow
1. Express middleware handles request parsing and logging
2. Route handlers validate input using Zod schemas
3. Storage layer (currently in-memory, designed for PostgreSQL) manages data persistence
4. Responses include proper error handling and status codes

### Database Schema
- **Users Table**: User authentication (planned)
- **Contact Submissions Table**: Form submissions with metadata
  - Fields: id, name, email, projectType, budgetRange, message, createdAt

## External Dependencies

- **Development**: Vite, TypeScript, ESLint
- **Forms**: React Hook Form, Zod validation
- **Icons**: Lucide React icons
- **Date Handling**: date-fns library

### Backend Dependencies
- **Server**: Express.js, TypeScript (tsx for development)
- **Database**: Drizzle ORM, Neon Database serverless driver
- **Validation**: Zod schema validation

### Build Dependencies
- **Bundling**: esbuild for server, Vite for client
- **Development**: Replit-specific plugins for development environment

## Deployment Strategy

### Development Environment
- **Server**: Node.js with tsx for TypeScript execution
- **Client**: Vite dev server with HMR
- **Database**: PostgreSQL connection via environment variables
- **Scripts**: `npm run dev` for development mode

### Production Build
- **Client**: Vite builds to `dist/public` directory
- **Server**: esbuild bundles server code to `dist/index.js`
- **Deployment**: Node.js production server serving static files and API
- **Database**: Production PostgreSQL via DATABASE_URL environment variable

### Environment Configuration
- **Database**: Requires `DATABASE_URL` environment variable
- **Build Process**: Separate client and server build steps
- **Static Assets**: Client build output served by Express in production
